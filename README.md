## Example

Having input like this (extracted and anonimized output from DD but you should be able to get similar output from your centralized logging service):

```csv
date,Host,Traceid,message
2021-06-23T08:52:58.506Z,server-app,2021-06-23T08:52:58.506613-11843,"Response..."
2021-06-23T08:52:56.952Z,server-app,2021-06-23T08:52:03.302112-11758,"Request received..."
.....
```

If we run the script:

```
go run main.go \
-csv /tmp/extract.csv \
-fieldId "Traceid" \
-fieldTs "date" \
-tsFormat "2006-01-02T15:04:05.999Z" \
-fieldMsg "message" \
-beginRegex "Request received" \
-endRegex "Response"
```

we should get as output HTML similar to this:

Which allows us to experience the timeline of the requests which take longer time or affect other requests
coming in in parallel threads.
